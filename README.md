Artimatic is a powerful web application designed to enable artists to create visually stunning generative art assets of asemic writing. Asemic writing is a unique style of writing that resembles written language but is not composed in any known language. This style of writing is open to interpretation, allowing artists to explore and experiment with different visual elements and create unique expressions of their creativity. With Artimatic, artists can easily harness the power of asemic writing and create visually stunning generative art assets that are sure to captivate and inspire their audiences. Artimatic was initially developed to cater to the needs of 3D environment artists and allows artists to include fantasy or alien-style writing in their projects with ease. Our software is packed with an array of features, including an art system that generates a canvas of generative text, and various inputs that allow the user to control the generative properties of the text.

1. Clone artimatic.
2. Navigate inside the artimatic directory and run **npm install --force** in the terminal.
